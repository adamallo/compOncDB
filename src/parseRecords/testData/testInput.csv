In lizards; yolk leakage has been associated with large vitellogenic follicles undergoing atresia (noted both grossly and histologically in this case). More specifically; yolk leakage in reptiles often is attributed to burst follicles; however; the underlying mechanism of such rupture has not been discovered. There was no evidence of an infectious agent or a neoplastic process within the examined sections. Stephanie French; DVM; MS © 2018 Michigan State University Board of Trustees.

6254519,KV Zoo,,,,39179,Arctic Fox,6211,, Tail gland hyperplasia Comments: This is a common condition in domestic dogs. It appears as thickened; seborrheic; hairless patch on the dorsal tail base. It may progress to a neoplasm; however; at this point I consider this to be simple hyperplasia. In male dogs castration helps to resolve the situation since it is somewhat hormonal dependent; however; this is reported to be a female so that will not help.,,,Female
6254520,KV Zoo,,,,39179,Arctic Fox,6213,, Kidney: renal cell carcinoma Comments: Renal cell carcinomas arise from the proximal convoluted tubular epithelium; and are by far the most common primary renal tumor in domestic dogs; so it is not suprising to encounter one in an fox. The large size and necrosis in the tumor are typical for this tumor.,,,Female
6254521,KV Zoo,,,,39237,Arctic Fox,2023,, Left foreleg: Severe open comminuted fracture of the radius and ulna; Transverse fractures of metacarpi and digit 2; Severe diffuse intramuscular and subcutaneous hemorrhage COMMENTS: The cause of clinical signs in this animal are from the lesions on the foreleg which were a result of trauma. There was no evidence of a puncture wound(s) to indicate bite lesions. Histopathology to more definitively characterize the other incidental lesions observed in this animal will be included in a final report. Ebony Gilbreath; DVM _ Kidney: Renal adenocarcinoma; Multiple renal infarctions; Membranous glomerulopathy; Focal parasitic granuloma; Possible corticomedullary renal amyloidosis Urinary bladder: Chronic multifocal cystitis Haired skin: Focally extensive suppurative crust and orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis Haired skin: Multifocal subcutaneous hemorrhage with hair shaft degeneration (presumptive) Skeletal muscle: Intermuscular lipoma Subcutis: Hemangioma Haired skin from tail: Hepatoid adenoma Haired skin from foreleg: Fibroadnexal hamartoma See gross report. COMMENTS: The cause of clinical signs and subsequent euthanasia is the broken leg as described in the gross necropsy report. The other histologic pathologic findings were likely incidental at the time of the traumatic event; but the renal and urinary bladder lesions may have limited this animal's later quality of life. Special stains are in progress to rule out the possibility of dermatophyte infection causing the irregular appearance of the hair shafts in the skin and to confirm the presence of amyloid in the kidney. Results will be forwarded in an addendum report. Ebony Gilbreath; DVM_ Thyoflavin T special stain: Negative for amyloid. COMMENTS: The described eosinophilic material observed histologically may have represented excess interstitial fibrous connective tissue. Ebony Gilbreath; DVM_,,,Female
6254522,KV Zoo,,,,39961,Arctic Fox,2768,, Open Comments: There were no significant gross lesions within the brain or viscera of this animal. Assessment of the calcium and phosphorus levels in bone are pending nutritional analysis. Final diagnosis is pending histopathologic evaluation of all tissues. Kristy A. Mietelka; D Liver: Mild; multifocal; lipid granulomas Pancreas: Mild; multifocal; periductal fibrosis Lung: Moderate congestion with multifocal alveolar edema Please see comments Comments: There is no evidence of a neurological deficit or structural abnormality to explain this animal's behavior. Bone ash concentrations of the rib bone and long bones were within the accepted reference range; indicating adequate osteoid mineralization. Multiple examined sections of the fractured ulna and radius had cortices of adequate thickness. The mild changes observed in the liver; pancreas; lung; and kidney are very mild; and likely had no effect on this animal's behavior. This completes testing for this case. Kristy A.

6254523,KV Zoo,,,,40135,Arctic Fox,12076,, Liver: Moderate diffuse congestion; Mild periportal lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis Urinary bladder: Moderate chronic-active interstitial cystitis with intralesional nematode (Capillaria sp.) COMMENTS: Striking microscopic findings in this case consist of the inflammatory process affecting the urinary bladder. A single nematode is present within the urinary bladder; and given its morphology is interpreted as Capillaria sp. Mammals with urinary capillariasis usually do not show clinical signs. When heavily infested; they may exhibit signs of urinary tract disease: pollakiuria; dysuria; and inappropriate micturition. In foxes; retarded growth has also been reported. Urinalysis may reveal mild proteinuria; microscopic hematuria; and the presence of an increased number of transitional epithelial cells. The diagnosis is made by finding Capillaria eggs in the urinary sediment. No overt microscopic findings of inflammation and necrosis are present in the lungs (i.e. no aspiration pneumonia). However; although unlikely; ruling out canine distemper is recommended given the mildly increased numbers of inflammatory cells surrounding occasional bronchioles and sloughed-off epithelial cells despite overt autolysis of the lung tissue. This test can be performed by means of PCR on shavings of the block or immunohistochemistry; and is available at the DCPAH; for an extra fee; upon request. Vinicius S. Carreira; D,,,Female
